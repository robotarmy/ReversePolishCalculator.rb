Programming Exercise: Code a Reverse-Polish Calculator  

In Reverse Polish notation the operators follow their operands; for instance, to add three and four one
would write "3 4 +" rather than "3 + 4". If there are multiple operations, the operator is given
immediately after its second operand; so the expression written "3 − 4 + 5" in conventional infix
notation would be written "3 4 − 5 +" in RPN: first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that.  

Example:
The infix expression "5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) − 3" can be written down like this in RPN:

      5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -  

Instructions:

Your Calculator should handle:  

1) At least 4 numbers in sequence 
2) The four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).  
3) Use “standard in”  and “standard out” to accept and return data. Pressing “q” should quit the
application.  In Java, you can use the following code for input/output:  

Sample:

>5
5
>1
1
>2
2
>+
3
>4
4
>*
12
>+
17
>3
3
>-
14
>q
goodbye
